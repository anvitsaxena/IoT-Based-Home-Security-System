# IoT-Based-Home-Security-System
This is the final project for my course CMPE 277 - Smartphone Application Development. This is an Android based IoT application which lets you click an image using push button connected to Raspberry Pi and display it on your android smartphone. I have also used Google's Machine learning technology called Google Vision API to detect the image.
