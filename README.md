# IoT-Based-Home-Security-System
This is the final project for my course CMPE 277 - Smartphone Application Development. This is an Android based IoT application which lets you click an image using push button connected to Raspberry Pi 3 and display it on your android smartphone. I have also used Google's Machine learning technology called Google Vision API to detect the image. This project uses Android Things as the IoT operating system installed in Raspberry Pi 3.


HomeOwner App: This is the Android phone application which will display and detect the image on phone whenever it is clicked using camera sensor connected to Raspberry Pi.
